    "This is the first of two sessions about `msprime`, a backwards-time tree sequence simulator. In this first worksheet, we will learn how to design simulations using customisable models of genomic history. In the next session, we will add mutations to these simulated histories to obtain sequence data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Some relevant papers:\n",
    " -  [Efficient coalescent simulation and genealogical analysis for large sample sizes](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004842)\n",

    "Simulations are important in population genetics for many reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exploration:**\n",
    "Simulations allow us to explore the influence of various historical scenarios on observed patterns of genetic variation and inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benchmarking and evaluating methodologies:**\n",
    "To assess the accuracy of inferential methods, we need test datasets for which the true values of important parameters are known.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model training:**\n",
    "Some methods for ancestry inference are trained on simulated data (eg. Approximate Bayesian Computation).\n",
    "This is especially important in studies of complex demographies, where there are many potential parameters and models, making it impractical to specify likelihood functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A brief history of msprime\n",
    "\n",
    "The first release of `msprime` was an emulation of the popular `ms` coalescent simulator with added support for tree sequences.\n",
    "However, it has since become an expansive and flexible backwards-in-time simulator for various different models of genetic ancestry and mutation, and even for simplified models of selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Forwards and backwards simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The main characteristic of `msprime` is that it simulates *tree sequences* in *backwards-time*.\n",
